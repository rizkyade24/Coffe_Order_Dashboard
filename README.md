# Coffe_Order_Dashboard
I have successfully created an informative and effective Coffee Order dashboard using Microsoft Excel. In this process, you utilize various Excel features and functions to present coffee sales data in an informative and easy-to-understand manner.

First, I collected and organized coffee sales data from available sources. Then, you utilize Excel's capabilities to process the data. Using various formulas, such as SUMIF to calculate total sales, and vlookup to link data, you successfully transform the dataset into interpretable information.

Next, you design stunning data visualizations. For example, you use line and area charts to visualize total sales over time, providing a clear view of sales trends from month to month or year to year.

Finally, I provide an interactive filter facility, allowing users to filter the data as per their preferences. In this way, this dashboard not only provides information, but also empowers users to explore and analyze data as per their needs.

With my expertise and understanding of using Excel, I have created an effective tool for managing and analyzing coffee sales data.
